Virtual tables, introduced in Apache Cassandraâ„¢ 4.0, allow exposing
metrics and properties of the node with the same interface as ordinary tables.
This enables a much easier pathway to observing the state, and the health,
of the cluster without leaving the CQL protocol.

In this scenario you will learn:

- how to look at virtual tables and their contents;
- what you _cannot_ do with virtual tables;
- what to expect if you change node settings;
